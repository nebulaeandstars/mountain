# Mountain

This is the beginning of a small
[mountain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=443UNeGrFoM&t=4672s) that combines
some simple tools that I wrote for other projects into a collection of
small, personal libraries.

Abstraction is good, but external libraries can be unreliable or undesired for
low-level use-cases. This is built with the notion that it's best to
re-implement the wheel *once* and only once, so that you understand how wheels
work but aren't turning into a tyre shop.
